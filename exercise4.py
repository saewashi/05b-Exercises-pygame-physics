In this exercise, you have a chance to play with music and sound effects.
Find some (appropriately licensed) background music online (I recommend http://freemusicarchive.org) and set it as the soundtrack for this exercise. You should have at least three pieces of music that play alternate randomly.
Then find some sound samples and make them play when keys are pressed. Describe the keys that play sound in your README.md.
There are many sources of Creative Commons licensed sound effects, but most of them require registering with the site.
If you want to add some graphics that are tied to either the music or the sound effects (or both), I will give you extra credit.
